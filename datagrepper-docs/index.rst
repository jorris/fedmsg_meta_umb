Topics and Example Messages
---------------------------
A list of topics and examples messages is available as part of the
`fedmsg_meta_umb documentation <{{URL}}umb/>`_.
If your service is publishing messages and you don't see them listed,
send a message to `exd-guild-messaging@redhat.com
<exd-guild-messaging@redhat.com>`_ and request that they be added to
`fedmsg_meta_umb <https://github.com/release-engineering/fedmsg_meta_umb>`_.

Prerequisites
-------------

If you've never interacted with a JSON API before, you should check out
the handy command-line tool `HTTPie
<https://github.com/jkbr/httpie#httpie-a-cli-curl-like-tool-for-humans>`_.
All our examples here will use it.  To install it on Fedora run ``$ sudo
yum -y install httpie`` (you'll need to enable epel7 on an el7 machine).

If you get stuck here, feel free to drop into the ``#pnt-devops-dev``
channel on `irc <https://mojo.redhat.com/search.jspa?q=how+to+irc>`_ to
ask questions or even just to give us a high five if everything goes well.

Requesting all messages in the last 2 days
------------------------------------------

datagrepper takes all time arguments in `seconds`, so we'll need to
convert 2 days to 172800 seconds first.  Then we can use `HTTPie
<https://github.com/jkbr/httpie#httpie-a-cli-curl-like-tool-for-humans>`_
like this::

    $ http get {{URL}}raw delta==172800

Paging results
--------------

You're going to get a large JSON response that's too big to read
through.  Try limiting the number of results to make it more
digestable::

    $ http get {{URL}}raw \
        delta==172800 \
        rows_per_page==1

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "arguments": {
            "delta": 1728000.0,
            "end": 1366221938.0,
            "page": 1,
            "rows_per_page": 1,
            "order": "desc",
            "start": 1364493938.0,
            "topics": [],
            "categories": [],
            "users": []
            "packages": [],
            "not_topics": [],
            "not_categories": [],
            "not_users": []
            "not_packages": [],
        },
        "count": 1,
        "pages": 2052,
        "raw_messages": [
            ...
        ],
        "total": 2052
    }

In the above output, the contents of ``raw_messages`` has been omitted for
readability.  Notice a few things: first, the ``arguments`` dict describes
all the parameters that datagrepper used to execute your query.  The
``start`` and ``end`` timestamps are included (they were derived from
the ``delta`` that you supplied). 

Your ``rows_per_page`` is there.  It has a sibling value ``page`` which
is a pointer to which "page" of data you are on.  You could issue the
following query to get the next one::

    $ http get {{URL}}raw \
        delta==172800 \
        rows_per_page==1 \
        page==2

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "arguments": {
            "delta": 1728000.0,
            "end": 1366221938.0,
            "page": 2,
            "rows_per_page": 1,
            "order": "desc",
            "start": 1364493938.0,
            "topics": [],
            "categories": [],
            "users": []
            "packages": [],
            "not_topics": [],
            "not_categories": [],
            "not_users": []
            "not_packages": [],
        },
        "count": 1,
        "pages": 2052,
        "raw_messages": [
            ...
        ],
        "total": 2052
    }


By default, the order of rows retrieved is from newest to oldest ("descending").
There is an ``order`` argument you can specify to set that how you like.  The
default is "desc", but you can set it to "asc" for ascending order, a.k.a.
from oldest to newest.

Only Errata messages (OR rpmdiff)
---------------------------------

There are many types of messages messages that come across the Unified Message
Bus. You can limit the scope of your query to only one kind of message by
specifying a ``category``::

    $ http get {{URL}}raw \
        delta==172800 \
        category==errata

Note that, in this example, ``category`` is singular but it comes back in
the ``arguments`` dict as *categories* (plural!)  You can specify more
than one category and messages that match *either* category will be returned.
They are **OR**'d together::

    $ http get {{URL}}raw \
        delta==172800 \
        category==errata \
        category==rpmdiff

Messages for a particular users and packages
--------------------------------------------

Just like categories, you can search for events relating to one or multiple
users::

    $ http get {{URL}}raw \
        delta==172800 \
        user==mikeb \
        user==rbean

Same goes for packages::

    $ http get {{URL}}raw \
        delta==172800 \
        package==nethack

Everything but the...
---------------------

There are corresponding *negative filters* for each of the above mentioned
positive filters.  For instance, if you wanted to get all messages **except for
Brew messages**, you could use this query::

    $ http get {{URL}}raw \
        delta==172800 \
        not_category==brew

You can combine positive and negative filters as you might expect to, for
instance, get all messages relating to the user tkuratom **except** for dist-git activity::

    $ http get {{URL}}raw \
        delta==172800 \
        user==tkuratom \
        not_category==distgit

Putting it all together (CNF)
-----------------------------

If you specify multiple ``category`` filters and multiple ``user`` filters
and multiple ``package`` filters, they are merged together in a way that looks
like `Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form>`_.

For example, this query will return all messages from the past 2 days where
*(category==errata OR category==brew) AND (user==psabata OR user==bkearney)*::

    $ http get {{URL}}raw \
        delta==172800 \
        category==errata \
        category==brew \
        user==psabata \
        user==bkearney
